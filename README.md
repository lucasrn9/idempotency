# idempotency
Disclaimer: The code in this repository, in its current state, should NEVER be used in a real-world application, as it does not implement several critical security measures (e.g., validation, authentication, authorization), which could lead to severe security vulnerabilities. The primary purpose of this repository is to understand and exemplify idempotency.

You can use the examples individually; however, they are designed to complement each other.
